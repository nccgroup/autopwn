TODO

1 - TDD?
1b) Have online repo where users can share yaml
    configs?
2 - What if tool requires root?
3 - Add support for:
- enum4linux
- nbtscan
- smb_scan
- w3af ?
- snmpwalk/check/etc
- dotdotpwn
- wp-scan
- davtest?
- DNS tools
- Harvester?
- recon tools?
4 - Flags
5 - Windows support?
6 - Improve Ctrl+c support
6b) Clean up files?
7 - If a tool doesn't like http:// or https://, need to specify what it does like
    (for example -ssl)
8 - Check return codes for commands
9 - Auto resolve ip if not specified using domain.. ip or domain *required*
10 - Improve command log file name to allow for multiple autopwn instances
10a) autopwn started/stopped logging entry
11 - Improve exit condition handling
12 - Multiple cookie options in target file
12b) Some tools take files, others expect cookies on the command line
12c) Could use a file regardless, but the user will have to know the
     format of the cookie, and this doesn't work will if the tool accepts
     cookie files..
12d) Sometimes the user will want to specify multiple cookies, this makes
     it more difficult to use placeholders the way autopwn does right now
12e) Need to be able to specify cookie key value pairs (with formatting)
     or cookie file
